      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >What are Junk Foods?</span>
      Any food that has no or negligible nutritional value can be considered as junk foods. Most of the fast foods, including candy, bakery products,
     burgers and sausages, salty and oily snacks or soft drinks can be categorized as junk food. They have a high calorie content, salts and fats.
      The more we consume these, the less is the intake of essential nutrients and vitamins in the body.
    <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Eating junk food cause following harms...</span>

      <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Increased Obesity</span>
    One of the most common side-effects of consuming junk foods is increased obesity. It's composition of loads of sugar,
     calories and fats contribute to weight-gain. Obesity can cause many medical issues like diabetes, joint-pain and heart diseases.

      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Loss of Memory and Learning Problems</span>
    A study published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition stated that people who ate junk food performed poorly in cognitive tests.
     It concluded that junk foods can deteriorate your memory and can leave with you with a weaker brain.
      It causes a sudden inflammation in the hippocampus in the brain which is responsible for memory and recognition.
<br>
  <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Lead to Depression</span>
    Junk foods are loaded with high sugar and fats that can cause certain chemical reactions in the brain which affect its functioning.
    By consuming too much of it, the body loses essential nutrients and amino acids.
    These symptoms eventually lead to inability of brain to deal with stress and can leave you feeling depressed.
<br>
  <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Worsens Appetite and Digestion</span>
    Consumption of excess junk food leaves the brain in a dilemma.
     Excessive sugar intake can cause blood sugar level to fluctuate and makes the brain demand more food, which eventually leads to overeating.
      It makes it difficult for the body to digest excessive junk food.
<br>
  <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Inadequate Growth & Development</span>
      Surviving on junk food causes deficiency of essential nutrients and vitamins required for the proper growth and development of the body.
       Unhealthy eating habits combined with imbalance of fatty acids and required nutrients can hamper the development of your brain and other body parts.
        Excess intake of soda and sugar also causes tooth decay and weakening of your bones.
      <br>
  <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >It makes you impatient and can cause uncontrollable cravings</span>

      Eating a sugary cupcake or doughnut may temporarily spike your blood sugar levels making you feel happy and satisfied but as soon as they return to normal you are left feeling all the more irritable.

      Fast food is packed with refined carbohydrates which cause your blood sugar levels to fluctuate rapidly.
       If your sugar levels dip to a very low level, it can cause anxiety, confusion and fatigue.  With high content of sugar and fats,
        you tend to eat too fast and too much to satisfy your cravings. This can inculcate an impatient behaviour while dealing with other things.
         Fast foods and processed foods may be laden with artificial flavourings and preservatives like sodium benzoate that tends to increase hyperactivity.
         <br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" > Lessens its ability to control appetit.</span>

Excess consumption of trans fats found in fried and processed foods can send mixed signals to the brain which makes it difficult to process what you have eaten and how hungry are. This is probably why you end up overeating.
 Healthy brain functions require a daily dose of essential fatty acids like omega-6 and omega-3.
 Deficiency of these two elements increases the risk of attention deficit disorder, dementia and bipolar disorder and other brain-related problems.

Over consumption of junk food may displace these with trans fats which are harder to digest. A 2011 study shows that trans fats may cause inflammation in hypothalamus, the part of brain that containing neurons to control body weight.

In worst scenarios, the habit of overeating can be similar to drug addiction to an extent that relying on junk foods may activate the pleasure centres of the brain greater than receiving drugs.
<br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Increases the risk of dementia</span>

This has been one of the scariest discoveries associated with the consumption of junk food.
 You may know that insulin is produced in the pancreas and helps in the transportation of glucose to fuel the body.
  Insulin is also produced in the brain where it helps in carrying signals between nerve cells and forming memories.
   A study conducted at the Brown University shows that too much fatty food and sweets can substantially increase the insulin levels in our body.

Just like in the case of Type 2 Diabetes, with higher levels of insulin, the brain stops responding to this hormone and become resistant to it. This can restrict our ability to think, recall or create memories, thus increasing the risk of dementia. Researcher Suzanne de la Monte, M.D., a professor of pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery at Rhode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University was the first to uncover this association. Following this discovery, most scientists refer to Alzheimer’s as a form of diabetes of the brain.
<br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >It can cause memory and learning problems</span>

A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2011 showed that healthy people who ate junk food for only 5 days performed poorly on cognitive tests that measured attention,
 speed, and mood. It concluded that eating junk food for just five days regularly can deteriorate your memory.
  This probably stems from the fact that a poor or toxic diet can cause certain chemical reactions that lead to inflammation in the hippocampus area of the brain which is associated with memory and special recognition.

Diets that are high in sugar and fat can suppress the activity of a brain peptide called BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) that helps with learning and memory formation.
Moreover,the brain contains synapses which are responsible for learning and memory. Eating too many calories can interfere with the healthy production and functioning of these synapses.
<br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Gives You Shortness Of Breath:</span>
Shortness of breath is a very normal factor when you have been eating junk food for a long time.
 It is due to the increase in blood sugar levels in the body because of the excess fat,
 carbohydrates and sodium which cause obesity and diabetes which work hand in hand to reduce your stamina due to all the health problems.
  Shortness of breath will surely decrease your working capacity greatly.
  <br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  Kidney Disease:</span>
Another serious effect of junk food on health is its impact on your excretory system.
Excessive consumption of junk food can lead to Kidney ailments.
 All this food gets converted into glucose and is transported into the Kidneys. The kidneys find it hard to eliminate them,
  causing them to wear and tear issues. This leads to malfunctioning of kidneys and even Kidney failure.
Don’t these effects of eating junk food shudder you? Our body is a holy place, which deserves respect,
cleanliness and attention. By loaded it with debris, (no wonder why it is called Junk), you are removing the sanctity of your inner self.
 The entire system goes in for a toss and makes your life Topsy-turvy.
  Most often, junk food causes irreversible damage to the body and waits upon an opportunity to attack you.
  Don’t let the luscious Jilebi or the packet of chips tempt you! It’s danger lurking in the corner!!
<br>
<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >Leads To Digestive Disorders:</span>
The ill-effects of junk food on the digestive system is quite known to us.
 The digestive system works well to burn down a good amount of carbohydrates to keep your blood sugar in check and also helps to keep your body healthy.
  The digestive though will go haywire when you keep on eating too much junk food because all kinds of junk food are loaded with excessive amounts of
   carbohydrates that will surely cause damage to your blood sugar levels.
   <br>
  <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" > Pumps Up Blood Pressure:</span>
Junk food also increases your blood pressure by a great extent in the long run and this is a very dominating factor in regards to getting heart attacks.
 You may be more resistant when you are young but with age, your body can be affected easily thus increasing your blood pressure and with it,
  heart problems.

<span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" > Increases LDL Levels:</span>
Junk food also affects your cholesterol levels which are necessary for the breakdown of fat and the maintenance of muscle.
 Cholesterol also maintains your blood levels keeping your heart healthy which is not possible with the intake of junk food ove

      <br><br><br>
    <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >1. Can Cause Weight Gain</span>
      Rates of obesity are rising worldwide and added sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, is thought to be one of the main culprits.

      Sugar-sweetened drinks like sodas, juices and sweet teas are loaded with fructose, a type of simple sugar.

      Consuming fructose increases your hunger and desire for food more than glucose, the main type of sugar found in starchy foods (3Trusted Source).

      Additionally, excessive fructose consumption may cause resistance to leptin, an important hormone that regulates hunger and tells your body to stop eating (4Trusted Source).

      In other words, sugary beverages don’t curb your hunger, making it easy to quickly consume a high number of liquid calories. This can lead to weight gain.

      Research has consistently shown that people who drink sugary beverages, such as soda and juice, weigh more than people who don’t (5Trusted Source).

      Also, drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to an increased amount of visceral fat,
      a kind of deep belly fat associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease
    <br>

      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  2. May Increase Your Risk of Heart Disease </span>
      High-sugar diets have been associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide (7Trusted Source).

      Evidence suggests that high-sugar diets can lead to obesity, inflammation and high triglyceride, blood sugar and blood pressure levels — all risk factors for heart disease (8Trusted Source).

      Additionally, consuming too much sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened drinks, has been linked to atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by fatty, artery-clogging deposits (9Trusted Source).

      A study in over 30,000 people found that those who consumed 17–21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% greater risk of dying from heart disease, compared to those consuming only 8% of calories from added sugar (10Trusted Source).

      Just one 16-ounce (473-ml) can of soda contains 52 grams of sugar, which equates to more than 10% of your daily calorie consumption, based on a 2,000-calorie diet (11).

      This means that one sugary drink a day can already put you over the recommended daily limit for added sugar.
   <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  3. Has Been Linked to Acne </span>
      A diet high in refined carbs, including sugary foods and drinks, has been associated with a higher risk of developing acne.

      Foods with a high glycemic index, such as processed sweets, raise your blood sugar more rapidly than foods with a lower glycemic index.

      Sugary foods quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, causing increased androgen secretion, oil production and inflammation, all of which play a role in acne development (12Trusted Source).

      Studies have shown that low-glycemic diets are associated with a reduced acne risk, while high-glycemic diets are linked to a greater risk (13Trusted Source).

      For example, a study in 2,300 teens demonstrated that those who frequently consumed added sugar had a 30% greater risk of developing acne (14Trusted Source).

      Also, many population studies have shown that rural communities that consume traditional, non-processed foods have almost non-existent rates of acne, compared to more urban, high-income areas (15Trusted Source).

      These findings coincide with the theory that diets high in processed,
      sugar-laden foods contribute to the development of acne.
   <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  4. Increases Your Risk of Type 2 Diabetes</span>
      The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled over the past 30 years (16Trusted Source).

      Though there are many reasons for this, there is a clear link between excessive sugar consumption and diabetes risk.

      Obesity, which is often caused by consuming too much sugar, is considered the strongest risk factor for diabetes (17Trusted Source).

      What’s more, prolonged high-sugar consumption drives resistance to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels.

      Insulin resistance causes blood sugar levels to rise and strongly increases your risk of diabetes.

      A population study comprising over 175 countries found that the risk of developing diabetes grew by 1.1% for every 150 calories of sugar, or about one can of soda, consumed per day (18Trusted Source).

      Other studies have also shown that people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice,
       are more likely to develop diabetes (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).
      <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  5. May Increase Your Risk of Cancer </span>
      Eating excessive amounts of sugar may increase your risk of developing certain cancers.

      First, a diet rich in sugary foods and beverages can lead to obesity, which significantly raises your risk of cancer (21Trusted Source).

      Furthermore, diets high in sugar increase inflammation in your body and may cause insulin resistance, both of which increase cancer risk (22Trusted Source).

      A study in over 430,000 people found that added sugar consumption was positively associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, pleural cancer and cancer of the small intestine (23Trusted Source).

      Another study showed that women who consumed sweet buns and cookies more than three times per week were 1.42 times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who consumed these foods less than 0.5 times per week (24Trusted Source).

      Research on the link between added sugar intake and cancer is ongoing, and more studies are needed to fully understand this complex relationship.
     <br>

      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  6. May Increase Your Risk of Depression</span>
      While a healthy diet can help improve your mood, a diet high in added sugar and processed foods may increase your chances of developing depression.

      Consuming a lot of processed foods, including high-sugar products such as cakes and sugary drinks, has been associated with a higher risk of depression (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).

      Researchers believe that blood sugar swings, neurotransmitter dysregulation and inflammation may all be reasons for sugar’s detrimental impact on mental health (27Trusted Source).

      A study following 8,000 people for 22 years showed that men who consumed 67 grams or more of sugar per day were 23% more likely to develop depression than men who ate less than 40 grams per day (28Trusted Source).

      Another study in over 69,000 women demonstrated that those with the highest intakes of added sugars had a significantly greater risk of depression,
       compared to those with the lowest intakes (29Trusted Source).
       <br>
        <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >7. May Accelerate the Skin Aging Process </span>
      Wrinkles are a natural sign of aging. They appear eventually, regardless of your health.

      However, poor food choices can worsen wrinkles and speed the skin aging process.

      Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are compounds formed by reactions between sugar and protein in your body. They are suspected to play a key role in skin aging (30Trusted Source).

      Consuming a diet high in refined carbs and sugar leads to the production of AGEs, which may cause your skin to age prematurely (31Trusted Source).

      AGEs damage collagen and elastin, which are proteins that help the skin stretch and keep its youthful appearance.

      When collagen and elastin become damaged, the skin loses its firmness and begins to sag.
      <br>
        <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >8. Can Increase Cellular Aging </span>
      Telomeres are structures found at the end of chromosomes, which are molecules that hold part or all of your genetic information.

      Telomeres act as protective caps, preventing chromosomes from deteriorating or fusing together.

      As you grow older, telomeres naturally shorten, which causes cells to age and malfunction (33Trusted Source).

      Although the shortening of telomeres is a normal part of aging, unhealthy lifestyle choices can speed up the process.

      Consuming high amounts of sugar has been shown to accelerate telomere shortening, which increases cellular aging (34Trusted Source).
      <br>
      <span style="color: black; font-weight: bold;" >  9. Drains Your Energy</span>
      Foods high in added sugar quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to increased energy.

      However, this rise in energy levels is fleeting.

      Products that are loaded with sugar but lacking in protein, fiber or fat lead to a brief energy boost that’s quickly followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar, often referred to as a crash (36Trusted Source).

      Having constant blood sugar swings can lead to major fluctuations in energy levels (37Trusted Source).

      To avoid this energy-draining cycle, choose carb sources that are low in added sugar and rich in fiber.

      Pairing carbs with protein or fat is another great way to keep your blood sugar and energy levels stable.
